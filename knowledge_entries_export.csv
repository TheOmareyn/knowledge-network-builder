46,15,1_20251113_231441_asutay.pdf,Conceptualising and locating the social failure of Islamic finance: Aspirations of Islamic moral economy vs the realities of Islamic finance,"Asutay, Mehmet",,Islamic Banking and Finance (IBF),What are the key principles of IBF as a value-oriented proposition within IME?,"IBF is a tenant-based proposition derived from Islamic ontology, emphasizing absence of interest, avoidance of speculation, and prohibition of contradicting Islamic values; it is principles-based, grounded in ethics and values akin to ethical investing, with emphasis on risk-sharing and profit-and-loss sharing, discouraging credit and debt products. It proposes embedded financing in the real economy through asset-backed transactions, aiming for stability and restraining consumer indebtedness. It is also society-oriented, serving the community with instruments for poverty reduction like zakah and qard hasan.","IBF is a tenant based ﬁ nancing proposition, as fundamental tenants are derived from the ontological sources of Islam, which is articulated in the ‘absence of interest-based transactions, ’ ‘avoidance of economic activity involving speculation, ’ and the ‘prohibition on production of goods and services which contradict the values of Islam.’ IBF is principles based, as the concept is grounded in ethics, values and norms derived from the Islamic ontology. Therefore, the principles of IBF are akin to ethical investing, and therefore, ethicality in funding and investing beyond the prohibition of riba is essential. In addition, importantly, IBF puts special emphasis on risk-sharing and partnership or pro ﬁ t-and-loss sharing contracts. In this ﬁ nancing proposition ‘credit and debt products are not encouraged ’ and were even eagerly discouraged so that real economy embedded ﬁ nancing as assumed by IME could be developed. IBF, as part of IME, proposes embedded ﬁ nancing—embedded in real economy, and therefore it offers an alternative ﬁ nancing paradigm. This is articulated in the principle of asset-backed transactions with investments in real, durable assets to contribute to the development of value added oriented real economy based ﬁ nancing of economic activity. As a consequence, IBF aims to bring about stability by linking ﬁ nancial services to the productive, real economy. On the demand side, IBF, as part of homoIslamicus, aims to restrain consumer indebtedness as credit is linked to real assets. IBF is a society oriented ﬁ nancing proposition, as it aims to serve the community and not the markets. Since IME aims to create a framework of developmentalist ﬁ nancing, instruments of poverty-reduction are an inherent part of IBF. For this purpose, in addition to Islamic ﬁ nancing of economic activity for development, zakah and qard hasan can be mentioned.",1-10
